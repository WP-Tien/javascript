    createTextNode() is a method and works just as its name says: it creates an element... then you must do something with it (like in your example, where you append it as a child);
    so it is useful if you want to have a new element and place it somewhere
    textContent is a property you may get or set, with a unique statement and nothing else;
    so it is useful when you only want to change the content of an already existing element
</pre>
<span>Original text</span>
<script>
    var span = document.querySelector('span');
    var my_text = document.createTextNode(' Hello!');
    span.appendChild(my_text);
</script>
