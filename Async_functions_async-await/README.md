## Ajax
Asynchronous Javascript And XML: Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically ( động );

---------------                  REQUEST (ask some data)       -----------
| Client      |----------------------------------------------> |Web       |
| e.g browser |                                                |Server    |(Usually a web API)
|             |<---------------------------------------------- |          |
______________|                  RESPONSE (sending data back)  |----------|

## API
- Application Programming Interface: Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other;
- There are be many types of APIs in web development: 
[DOM API] [Geolocation API] [Own Class API] ["Online" API]

- "Online" API: Application running on a server, that receives, reuests for data, and sends data back as response;

- We can build our web APIs (requires back-end development, e.g with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs.
