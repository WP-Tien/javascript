   // Here, we defined a number called "number1" which was equal to 5. However, on the second line, we change the value to 3, To show the value of a variable. we log it to the console

    window.alert(number1); //3

    // To add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc., we do like so: 
    

    number1 = number1 + 5; // 3 + 5 = 8

    // We also add strings which all concatenate them, or put them together. 

    var myString = "I am a " + "string!"; // "I am a string !"
